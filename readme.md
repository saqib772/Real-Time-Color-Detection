# Color Detection with OpenCV

This is a simple Python script that demonstrates color detection using OpenCV. The script allows you to adjust trackbars to define a specific color range in the HSV color space. It then detects objects of that color in real-time using a webcam or video source.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```shell
   pip install opencv-python numpy
```

Additional Functionality
The current implementation provides a basic color detection setup. However, there are several ways you can enhance its functionality:

Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) to improve usability.
Allow users to save and load trackbar values for convenience.
Add color selection functionality to automatically set the trackbar values based on a selected pixel.
Implement object tracking to track the detected color in real-time.
Extend input options to accept images or videos from files.
Optimize the code for better performance by applying image preprocessing or downsampling techniques.
Feel free to explore these additional features based on your specific requirements and application.
